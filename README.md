# Summary

This repo contains materials surrounding an analysis of collision data in Los Angeles.
Below is a description of the file structure.
I recommend starting with the Word document or RMarkdown HTML file.
Code and details are in the R script.
I also published an associated blog post here: [TO FILL IN].
